# Bindable Element

## Introduction
Web components is a important part of web development today.  
Bindable element is a class that extends HTMLElement and allows you to write components that make use of crs-binding.  
Though this does create a dependency on crs-binding it also reduces development effort.  
At a 5.5k compressed payload the gains far exceed the additional dependency. 

## Using
The BindableElement class comes in a separate file to the main binding engine, but since it uses the main binding engine you will still need to include that in your index page as per normal.

Creating a new file for your component you can import it using ES6 modules.

```js
import {BindableElement} from "/node_modules/crs-binding/crs-bindable-element.js";
```

Once you have that imported you can create your component as per usual

```js
class MyComponent extends BindableElement {
    static get properties() {
        return ["items"];
    }

    get html() {
        return import.meta.url.replace(".js", ".html");
    }

    get items() {
        return this.getProperty("items");
    }

    set items(newValue) {
        this.setProperty("items", newValue);
    }

    async connectedCallback() { 
        await super.connectedCallback();
        // ... do some stuff here
    }

    async disconnectedCallback() {    
        super.disconnectedCallback();
        // ... do some stuff here
    }

    load() {
        /*
         ... perform initialize of resources as part of the connectedCallback process 
         but before the ready event is fired.
        */
    }
}

customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
```

The above example represents the basic structure for a web component using BindableElement.  
Things to take note of:

1. html getter defined where to find the html file to use as innerHTML of the component. If you don't want your innerHTML overwritten or you don't have a html file you need to return null in this getter and mange that yourself.
1. The element instance is used as the context for the parsing so all binding expressions are relative to the element's class.
1. connectedCallback and disconnectedCallback differs a little from the standard as these are async. If you are not loading a html file you can take the async off.
1. Once the component ready it raises a event "ready"
1. The properties property defines an array of property names that is bound to from the outside and needs to be auto refreshed.  When in doubt if you should add it, just add it.

## No HTML
In the case where you don't have a html file to go with your component and you do something else there are some important steps you must perform once you are ready.

```js
    crsbinding.parsers.parseElements(this.children, this);
    crsbinding.expression.updateUI(this);
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("ready"));
```

## Properties
Elements can not be made into proxies as we do with other context items.
For this reason the property getters and setters in these components are import, especially the setter as it is responsible for notifying the engine that changes took place.

```js
get items() {
    return this.getProperty("items");
}

set items(newValue) {
    this.setProperty("items", newValue);
}
```

If you choose not to do it this way, you need to make sure that `crsbinding.events.notifyPropertyChanged(this, propertyName);` is called.
The `setProperty` function also takes care of some other complex operations so it is recommended that you do as shown above.

## Observing attribute changes
All binding from crs-binding set's the property of the element but there are times when attributes can be updated.
If you want to be notified that an attributes value has changed, you can enable that by using the BindableElement's `observeAttributes` function.

```js
async connectedCallback() { 
    this.observeAttributes(["src"]);
}
```

This function will create a mutation observer and attach it to the element as a `this.observer` property.
The callback for this operation is the `attributesChanged` function on the element. If you want to override the default behavior you can just override this function.

When an observed attribute does change it will look for a function with a particular name.
The naming convention for this is {attribute Name}AttributeChanged. e.g. srcAttributeChanged;

The parameters passed to this function are:
1. mutation.target[mutation.attributeName] 
1. mutation.oldValue

## Disposing
When you remove the element from the DOM, it will call the disconnectedCallback as per usual.
It is recommended that the super for disconnectedCallback is executed first as this function marks the element as in process of disposal.
This stops value change events from firing when you start clearing properties on your element. See the example at the top.
