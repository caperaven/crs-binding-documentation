# Repeat UI

## Introduction
There are cases when you need to build up UI that repeats a defined structure.
Given an array you need to create a new instance of the template element and bind it to the item.

```html
<div>
    <template for="contact of person.contacts" data-reference="contact">
        <label>
            <div>Cell Number</div>
            <input value.bind="contact.cell">
        </label>
    </template>
</div>
```

person is a property on the binding context.
The person object has an array property called contacts.
For each object in the array the structure.  
Note the data-reference attribute on the template.  
This is a optional attribute that you can use for debugging the data structure.  
For each list item a context is created in the binding data and the name of that context is normally "array-item".  
If you want provide a different contextual name for the item, you can do so by setting a data-reference attribute to the name you want uses.

```html
<label>
    <div>Cell Number</div>
    <input value.bind="contact.cell">
</label>
```

will be added to the `div` parent element.

The syntax here borrows from the JavaScript for syntax.
You have to provide a context in for the item in the array. 
In the above example it is `"contact"`. When defining binding expressions you need to base it on the context name you provided.
You can see an example of this on the input binding `"contact.cell"`

One thing that is not wise to do is to define events on each item.
That is bad practice even with out binding. Rather define your events on the parent element and use the target property on the event to find out what child was interacted on.

For static implementations you can use `for.once` instead of just `for`.  
The syntax looks the sake but the result is much different.  
`for.once` uses the inflation manager and generates static UI.  
Once this UI is introduced to the dom it will not change again even if the data does change.  
The upside to this is that it uses much less overhead because it does not have to listen to changes.

The standard `for` will respond to data changes in the array objects and update bindings and also to array structure changes.  
The cost you pay for this is the listener and update overhead required to make this work.

If you do not expect changes, for example you are generating a list of options for a select, rather use `for.once`.

```html
<template for.once="item of items">
    <div>${item.title}</div>
</template>
```

Sometimes you are dealing with an array of values.  
In those cases you can use the defined context name directly.

```html
<template for.once="item of items">
    <div data-title="{item}">${item}</div>
</template>
```

NOTE: `for.once` creates the UI and does not monitor it after the fact.  
Because of this, you can bind using an array of values.
  
`for` interacts with the UI after the initial create process.  
Because of this, markers are placed on objects used in the `for` operation.  
This means that you must use an object when using `for` NOT just values. 

## $parent

```html
<template for="item of items" data-reference="main-collection">
    <li>
        <div>${item.title}</div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked.bind="item.isDone" />
        <tasks-summary parent.bind="item"></tasks-summary>

        <select value.bind="item.priority">
            <template for.once="priority of $parent.priorities">
                <option value="${priority.id}">${priority.title}</option>
            </template>
        </select>

        <button click.call="$parent.removeThis($event)" aria-label="${$parent.translations.remove}">${$parent.translations.remove}</button>
    </li>
</template>
```

In the above example, we are looping through an array "items"  
For each "item" build up some ui.  
Part of that ui needs to refer to the origional context not the "item".
The origional context contains an array property called "priorities".   
Bind that to the select so that we can for each item display the priorities without having to duplicate the data over each item.  

To accomplish this, you can refer to the origional context using the "$parent" keyword.

## Maps
You can bind to map objects in the same way

```html
<template for.map="item of data">
    <div data-key="${item.key}">${item.value.title}</div>
</template>
```

The one difference is that the item object will have two properties.

1. key
1. value

## Radio groups

Radio groups can be iffy to work with, so we added a provider to make it easier.  
This expression uses `for.radio` on a template with an additional `property` attribute.  
Please note that this operates much the same way as an `for.once`, once the list is printed that is it.  
The data should also be populated during the preLoad function to ensure it is there by the time the elements are being processed.

The property attribute is the property relative to the binding context that will be set with the selected radio's value attribute.

```html
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column" id="people">
    <template for.radio="person of people" property="selectedPerson">
        <label>
            <input value="${person.value}" />
            <span>${person.title}</span>
        </label>
    </template>
</div>
```

Consider the above example:
  
1. Ensure this is done inside of a parent element that acts as a container for that group.
1. You must provide the for.radio and property attributes on the template.
1. You don't need to provide the type or name attributes, that is filled in for you.
1. The name attribute will be set to the collection path you define in the for.radio expression.

When creating the elements, if the value of the input matches the value of the value in the property you defined on the template that input will be marked as checked.

As you move the mouse, the div's content will show the mouses x and y positions. No additional code required.  
So if this is my data:

```js
this.setProperty("people", [
    {
        id: 1,
        title: "John",
        value: 1
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "Samantha",
        value: 2,
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        title: "Rodger",
        value: 3
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        title: "Mike",
        value: 4
    }
])

this.setProperty("selectedPerson", 2);
```

As you can see from the template, the structure you want for the generated radio button is up to you.  
The input is the only element that is updated during the render process.  
This gives you a fair amount of flexibility to do what you want in this space.
