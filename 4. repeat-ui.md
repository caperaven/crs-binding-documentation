# Repeat UI

## Introduction
There are cases when you need to build up UI that repeats a defined structure.
Given an array you need to create a new instance of the template element and bind it to the item.

```html
<div>
    <template for="contact of person.contacts" data-reference="contact">
        <label>
            <div>Cell Number</div>
            <input value.bind="contact.cell">
        </label>
    </template>
</div>
```

person is a property on the binding context.
The person object has an array property called contacts.
For each object in the array the structure.  
Note the data-reference attribute on the template.  
This is a optional attribute that you can use for debugging the data structure.  
For each list item a context is created in the binding data and the name of that context is normally "array-item".  
If you want provide a different contextual name for the item, you can do so by setting a data-reference attribute to the name you want uses.

```html
<label>
    <div>Cell Number</div>
    <input value.bind="contact.cell">
</label>
```

will be added to the `div` parent element.

The syntax here borrows from the JavaScript for syntax.
You have to provide a context in for the item in the array. 
In the above example it is `"contact"`. When defining binding expressions you need to base it on the context name you provided.
You can see an example of this on the input binding `"contact.cell"`

One thing that is not wise to do is to define events on each item.
That is bad practice even with out binding. Rather define your events on the parent element and use the target property on the event to find out what child was interacted on.

## Maps
You can bind to map objects in the same way

```html
<template for.map="item of data">
    <div data-key="${item.key}">${item.value.title}</div>
</template>
```

The one difference is that the item object will have two properties.

1. key
1. value
