# SVG support

## Introduction
This document will provide some examples of how to interact with svg using crs-binding.
This includes things like

1. setting text
1. changing the fill or stroke values based on conditions
1. animation

## Text
```html
<text x="10" y="20">${title}</text>
```

In this example you can see how the title text binding works.  
Simply, it is the same way as you would update text on any other text DOM Element using the inner expression using the string template syntax.

## Fill and Stroke
Lets say that you want to change the fill and stroke colors depending on a condition.

```html
<text x="10" y="20" fill.if="isActive == true ? 'green' : 'red'">${title}</text>
```

The attribute here needs to be `fill="green"` but if you remove the string quotes from the color names the binding engine thinks you are trying to bind it to a property on the context. In this case you define the color between string quotes and the binding engine will remove them for you when setting the attribute.

The end result being

```html
<text x="10" y="20" fill="green">SVG Test</text>
```

## Animation
Animation in this case just means moving objects around, not the tweening of objects.  
For transition effects use css.  

There are two types of updates.

1. immediate - update ui as values change
1. delayed - make a bunch of changes and only update when you want

### Immediate example
Lets start by initializing the data object on the binding context.

```js
preLoad() {
    this.setProperty("circle", {x: 30, y: 100, r: 20});
}
```

Consider the following html

```html
<svg width="800" height="200">
    <circle cx.attr="circle.x" cy.attr="circle.y" r.attr="circle.r" style="fill: #ffbb00"></circle>
</svg>
```

As we change position and size values of the circle we want it to update as we make the changes.  
For this you do not set the value directly on the model as you would on the delayed, but instead use `setProperty`.

```js
this.setProperty("circle.x", this.getRndInteger(30, 770));
this.setProperty("circle.r", this.getRndInteger(10, 100));
```

### Delayed example
Create a list of circles for each data item.

```html
<svg width="800" height="200">
    <template for="item of items">
        <circle cx.attr="item.x" cy.attr="item.y" r.attr="item.r" style.fill.if="item.r < 7 ? 'green' : 'red'"></circle>
    </template>
</svg>
```

On animation loop, update the values and update when all the changes have been made.

```js
const array = this.getProperty("items");

for (let item of array) {
    item.y = this.getRndInteger(10, 200);
    item.r = this.getRndInteger(5, 10);
    crsbinding.data.updateUI(item);
}
```

In this example we are updating the values directly on the data object and telling the binding engine to update the item once all the changes has been made.
