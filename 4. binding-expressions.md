# Binding expressions

## Introduction
It is finally time to look at binding expressions.  
Before we get into the details of it we need to first be clear as to what kind of binding crs-binding supports.  

1. Once off binding that sets the initial html value on startup and then never again.
1. One way binding that updates the DOM with changes on the model
1. Two way binding that is commonly used when you don't want to just update the DOM but also the model should element properties change. Think inputs as a example.
1. Conditional binding
1. Style binding

Binding on the DOM primarily sets the element's property.   
So when I bind to the value of a input it updates the value property and not the attribute.  
You can however bind specifically to an attribute but we will deal that particulars about that in that section.
You can also bind to events on elements that trigger functions on the model. This will become more clear when we look at examples.

There is also what we call inflation and though this is DOM update work, it is technically  not binding event though that is a crs-binding feature.
More detail on that later also.

## Once Off Binding

```js
<h2 inner-text.once="title"></h2>
<input value.once="title" />
```

In these examples, the values will be copied from the context to the DOM but there are not listeners set up to keep it up to date.
This is an memory efficient binding that should be considered for static items such as labels, headings ...
The input example here is not really practical, but just a example of syntax.

## One Way Binding

This binding will copy data to the DOM each time the value changes.  
There is the initial copy and then each time the property changes.
There are a number of ways you can express a one way binding.

```html
// using inner text binding expressions
<div>${firstName}</div>
<div>My name is: ${data.firstName}</div>

// using binding attributes on data- attributes
<div data-name="${data.firstName}"></div>

// using the .one-way postfix on a given property you want to set
<input value.one-way="data.firstName" />
```

When you use the postfix method, you are explicitly telling the binding engine how to treat the binding.
In those cases you don't need to use the string literal "${}" syntax. In the cases of the innerText the binding engine needs to understand where to put the values and what is just text. Here we reuse the string literal / template syntax from JavaScript as if you are formatting text. The same applies to the attribute binding. If the binding engine spots the "${}" syntax in the text it treats it as a one way binding.

## Two Way Binding

Two way binding inherits from one way but also adds event listeners to update the model when DOM changes happen. This is mostly used when binding with inputs, selects ... or custom elements that need to push data back to the model.

```html
<input value.two-way="data.firstName" />
```

You can also use the `.bind` syntax

```html
<input value.bind="data.firstName" />
```

This syntax is a bit more tricky but can also be very convenient. If the attribute you are defining on is either "value" or "checked" it will automatically use two way binding. If not it will use one way binding.

```html
<input checked.bind="isVisible" type="checkbox">

<select value.bind="selected">
    <option value="0">Option 0</option>
    <option value="1">Option 1</option>
    <option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select>
```

## Conditional attribute binding

This is an attribute binding meaning that it updates the attributes of an element and not the property.

In these bindings you define a boolean expression.
The syntax will determine one of two things.

1. Set the attribute with a value 
1. Set the attribute or remove it

A common use case for this is to show or hide a element by binding the hidden attribute to an condition.

```html
<div hidden.if="isActive == false">Some Text</div>
```

In the above example if the property isActive is false attribute will be present and if not, it will be removed

```html
<div data-value="isActive == true ? 'Yes'"></div>
```

In this example if the expression passes the data-value is set to a string value "Yes" but if it fails the attribute will be removed.

```html
<div data-value="isActive == true ? 'Yes' : 'No'"></div>
```

This example has a pass and fail value. Either way the attribute will be set depending on success of the expression.

When the isActive property on the context changes the expression will be tested again and the required updates made.

## Style Binding

Style binding takes on two forms

1. Updating the class list 
1. Updating the style property of the element

Style binding looks and operates the same way as conditional attribute binding in that it uses the `if` syntax and also a condition.

### Class List

This binding uses the attribute `classlist`. 
You can still use the class attribute freely.

```html
<div classlist.if="isActive == true ? 'green'"></div>
```

In this case the class 'green' will be added to the element's class list if the expression passes.

You can also add and remove multiple classes in the expression.

```html
<div classlist.if="isActive == true ? ['green', 'italic'] : 'red'"></div>
```

### Style

The style binding can bind to a property on the binding context or using the `if` expression.

```html
<div style.background.one-way="background"></div>
```

When the background property on the context changes the element's style.background property will be set to that value. It should thus be a valid CSS value.

With regards to the `if` expression I think by now you get the point so instead of belaboring it here are two examples.

```html
<div style.background.if="isActive == true ? 'blue'"></div>
<div style.background.if="isActive == true ? 'blue' : 'red'"></div>
```

## Binding to events

HTMLElements have events and when a event occurs you want a function to be called on the binding context. The syntax for this is the event's name followed with ".call".

```html
<button click.call="btnClicked">Normal</button>
<button click.call="btnClicked($event)">With Event</button>
<button click.call="btnClicked('hello world', $event)">With Parameters</button>
```

Above are three examples.  
All of these will call the `btnClicked` function when clicked.
The first example will not pass in any parameters.
The second will pass the mouse event and the third a static text and the mouse event.
