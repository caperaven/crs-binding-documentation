# HTML Fragments

## Introduction

HTML fragments allows you to import HTML files at a given location.  
This solves two main problems.

1. Lightweight reuse of elements without having all the web component overhead.
1. Clean up heavy markup into seperate files.

## Performance

Separating out HTML can have a performance impact.  
It is strongly recommended that you use HTTP2 with this along with push notifications.

## Syntax

For fragments, you use a standard template element but provide it with a relative source attribute.

```html
<template src="./fragment/fragment1.html"></template>
```

## Using fragments with view base

You need to know the source location so that relative paths can be calculated from that point.  
Bindable element has a html property it uses to define where to get the components html file.  
We are reusing this property to calcuate the relative path in a bindable element.  
For consistancy sake we reuse the same property and syntax in the view model.  

```html
get html() {
    return import.meta.url;
}
``` 

This is a requirement for fragments to work.
Since you are doing this already in the bindable element, you just need to remember to do this on the view model.
