# Static UI

## Introduction
Static UI int he context of this document we will refer to as inflation.  
Let me explain what this means and how it works.

Not all UI requires data updates that require binding.
Some examples of this are 

1. static lists
1. select

Let say I have a list of data. 
For each item in that list I want to generate repetative ui.
Typically you need to create a template element for the UI to repeat and loop through each item in your data and create a new template instance.
The problem comes in on populating your instance where the data parts need to go.
That process we call inflation, taking a data item and copying the values to where they need to go in your element created from a template.
In other words, inflate your element with data.

This is also a very nice way to create custom components such as data grids, lists, trees...

## Garbage collection
Garbage collection is a expensive operation and though creating new objects is cheap enough, garbage collecting them is not.
When working on virtualized systems it may be in your best interest to maintain a element store so that you can reuse elements that are removed due to them scrolling out of view.

In these cases you don't want to retain the information in the element from the last data item that inflated it.
Due to this the inflation manager also provides a deflate feature. 
Deflating a element removes the set data from the required places but only removes information at the loctions origionally inflated.

This means you can re-inflate a element with a new data model when it comes into service again.

## Common Steps

1. Create the template that defines the UI structure.
1. Register the template with the inflation manager.
1. Get instances for the UI from the inflation manager.
1. Unregister the template once done.

## Example

Lets start off with defining a simple HTMLTemplateElement.

```html
<template id="person-template">
    <div >${firstName}</div>
    <div>${lastName}</div>
    <div classlist.if="age < 18 'red' : 'black'">${age}</div>
</template>
```

For most of the time, all the expressions are attribute or innerText expressions using the string template "${}" syntax.
The exceptions to this is style binding where the syntax is exactly the same as it is in normal binding.
The big difference being that the evaluation takes place during the inflation process and not again.

Now that we have the template let's register it with the inflation manager and give it an id to identify it by.

```js
const template = this._element.querySelector("#person-template");
crsbinding.inflationManager.register("list-item", template);
```

Now that you have it you can request UI from the inflation manager using the id that you defined in the first parameter.

```js
const data = getData();
const fragment = crsbinding.inflationManager.get("list-item", data);
this.list.appendChild(fragment);
```

In the above code we get an array of data items from our source.  
Then we ask the inflation manager to give us back a list of elements inflated with the data items.  
The result of this is a document fragment.  
We then add it the elements to the relevant DOM element for display.

If you are done with an element, before you send it to your element store, you can deflate it this way.

```js
crsbinding.inflationManager.deflate("list-item", element);
```

The second parameter can either be a individual element or an array of elements.

## Using inflation with for binding
Lets say that we want to populate a combobox with a list of items that get returned from the server.
You can follow the procedure above but it would be more convenient if you could just use a binding expression in the HTML.

```html
<select value.bind="selectedId">
    <template for.once="item of items">
        <option value="${item.id}">${item.caption}</option>
    </template>
</select>
```

Note the `.once` synatx postfixing the for attribute.
This will use the inflation manager under the hood to statically generate the options you need for the select.
The result of this operation looking like this in the inspector.

```html
<select>
    <option value="1">Item 1</option>    
    <option value="2">Item 2</option>
    <option value="3">Item 3</option>
</select>
```

## Optional elements
You may want to remove elements if it fails a binding condition.  
This allows you to use one template but cater for more than one scenario.  
To remove a element you can use the `remove.if` attribute.

```html
<div remove.if="title == null ? true">${title}</div>
```

This will cost you a little more processing when building the UI but keep your dom structure clean of redundent elements.
