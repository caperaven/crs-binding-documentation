# Bindable Element

## Introduction
Web components is a important part of web development today.  
Bindable element is a class that extends HTMLElement and allows you to write components that make use of crs-binding.  
Though this does create a dependency on crs-binding it also reduces development effort.  

## Using
The BindableElement class comes in a separate file to the main binding engine, but since it uses the main binding engine you will still need to include that in your index page as per normal.

Creating a new file for your component you can import it using ES6 modules.

```js
import {BindableElement} from "/node_modules/crs-binding/crs-bindable-element.js";
```

Once you have that imported you can create your component as per usual

```js
class MyComponent extends BindableElement {
    get html() {
        return import.meta.url.replace(".js", ".html");
    }

    get items() {
        return this.getProperty("items");
    }

    set items(newValue) {
        this.setProperty("items", newValue);
    }

    async connectedCallback() { 
        await super.connectedCallback();
        // ... do some stuff here
    }

    async disconnectedCallback() {    
        await super.disconnectedCallback();
        // ... do some stuff here
    }

    preLoad() {
        /* 
            Perform operations that need to be in place before the HTML is parsed.
            Typically if you have a once binding, you need to ensure that the values are in place before parsing takes place.
            This is where you will do that.
        */       
    }

    load() {
        /*
            ... perform initialize of resources as part of the connectedCallback process 
            but before the ready event is fired.
        */
    }
}

customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
```

The above example represents the basic structure for a web component using BindableElement.  
Things to take note of:

1. html getter defined where to find the html file to use as innerHTML of the component. If you don't want your innerHTML overwritten or you don't have a html file you need to return null in this getter and mange that yourself.
1. The element instance is used as the context for the parsing so all binding expressions are relative to the element's class.
1. connectedCallback and disconnectedCallback differs a little from the standard as these are async. If you are not loading a html file you can take the async off.
1. Once the component ready it raises a event "ready"

## No HTML
There may be cases when you don't load a HTML file for your component.
It may be that you will create the UI manually or via some schema generation process.
In such cases you will need to parse the element when you are ready.

```js
    crsbinding.parsers.parseElements(this.children, this);
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("ready"));
```

Only call the ready event when the component is actually ready.

## Properties
Here is a example of a property getter and setter.

```js
get items() {
    return this.getProperty("items");
}

set items(newValue) {
    this.setProperty("items", newValue);
}
```
Note that it uses getProperty and setProperty.  
This is only required if the property of that element is being used for binding purposes.

On a custom element, some properties may be used for binding and others used for internal use.  
The binding engine stores the data in the binding store.  
getProperty reads data from the store and returns that too you.  
setProperty writes data to the store.  
If a property is used for internal use you don't need to save those values in the store.  
Only items in the store is available for binding expressions to make use of.

It is important to note that by default here that there are no listeners attached to properties or objects.  
This no proxies or observers.  

When updating the values on the binding store using set property, it then performs all the required updates needed.

## Disposing
When you remove the element from the DOM, it will call the disconnectedCallback as per usual.
