# Viewbase

## Introduction
For this example we will use mvvm as a example.

MVVM consist out of the following parts:

1. Model (data)
1. View (html)
1. View Model (class associated with view)

crs-binding has a base class to use as a view model.  
If you have crs-binding installed using npm, you will find it at:
`./node_modules/crs-binding/crs-view-base.js`

For this example we will use a index.html and index.js file as a mvvm example;
We are going to try and keep the code to a minimum just to demonstrate the setup procedure.

<strong>First you need a view model</strong>

`index.js`
```js
import {ViewBase} from "./node_modules/crs-binding/crs-view-base.js";

export default class Index extends ViewBase {
    async connectedCallback() {
        this.title = "View Base Example";
        super.connectedCallback();
    }

    doSomething() {
        console.log("Hello World");
    }
}
```

<strong>Next you need the view</strong>

```html
<body style="visibility: hidden">
    <header>
        <h1>${title}</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="toolbar">
            <button click.call="doSomething">Do Something</button>
        </div>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <div>copyright @me</div>
    </footer>

    <script type="module" src="./node_modules/crs-binding/crs-binding.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
        import Index from "./index.js";
        document.viewModel = new Index(document.body);

        window.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
            document.viewModel.connectedCallback();
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

Please note that the body stile is set to be hidden.  
Parsing of the dom happens on the connected callback.  
As part of that process, once binding has taken place it will set the visibility to "" thus making it visible.
This prevents you from seeing the markup text on screen before the binding is done.

So lets break down the steps here.

1. We created the index.js file that defines a simple view model. In this view model we set the title to a desired text in the connectedCallback.   
Though this is not a webcomponent, we treat it as if it was one through convention enforced by crs-binding.  
1. We create the index.html file that contains our markup for the view.  
Note that we are importing crs-binding from the npm install and creating a instance of the view model, passing in the element that represents the body of our view.  
This element will be parsed for binding.

## Simple expressions
In this example we can see traces of the binding expressions. We will deal with those in more detail in up coming documentation but note the syntax the h1 and click attribute of the button.
When this page is rendered, the title you set in the view model will display in the h1 and when you click on the button, the view model's doSomething function is called.

## Getting hold of the view model's element
There are times in your code that you may want to get a hold of the view models HTMLElement.
The view model has a property called `element`. This is where you will find the element.

## Conclusion
This is a simple example but this alongside `BindableElement` it forms the foundation assumed when looking at binding expressions in other documentation.
