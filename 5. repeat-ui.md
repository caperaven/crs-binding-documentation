# Repeat UI

## Introduction
There are cases when you need to build up UI that repeats a defined structure.
Given an array you need to create a new instance of the template element and bind it to the item.

```html
<div>
    <template for="contact of person.contacts">
        <label>
            <div>Cell Number</div>
            <input value.bind="contact.cell">
        </label>
    </template>
</div>
```

person is a property on the binding context.
The person object has an array property called contacts.
For each object in the array the structure

```html
<label>
    <div>Cell Number</div>
    <input value.bind="contact.cell">
</label>
```

will be added to the `div` parent element.

The syntax here borrows from the JavaScript for syntax.
You have to provide a context in for the item in the array. 
In the above example it is `"contact"`. When defining binding expressions you need to base it on the context name you provided.
You can see an example of this on the input binding `"contact.cell"`

One thing that is not wise to do is to define events on each item.
That is bad practice even with out binding. Rather define your events on the parent element and use the target property on the event to find out what child was interacted on.

## Data

You need to observe the array if you intend to use it with a repeat.

```js
const items = crsbinding.observation.observe([...data]);
```

## Behavior

When a item is added to the array will add an element on the UI for that item at the required location. Removing an item from the array will also remove the relevant element from the UI.

If you change a property on a item in the list and there is a binding on that property it will update the UI with the relevant change.
