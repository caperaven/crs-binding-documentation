## Introduction
There are some coding features you may wish to take note of.  
This document will describe some of those features, how and why to use them.

## Create a bindable context

A bindable context is the core mechanism for the binding engine.
It creates an object and events data structure.
You can use this structure to for binding and notifications.

```
const contextId = crsbinding.data.addObject(name);
```

Then name attribute helps you identify the context in the data for debugging purposes.  
The `addObject` function will create all the required internals and send you back a context id used for all other calls.    
All calls on the `crsbinding.data` path requires the context id as the first parameter.  
These functions will also accept as the first parameter a object with a field `_dataId`.

Here are two examples function calls, one with the id and the other with an object that has a `_dataId` field. 

```js
this._dataId = crsbinding.data.addObject(name);
crsbinding.data.setProperty(this._dataId, "propertyName", "propertyValue");
crsbinding.data.setProperty(this, "propertyName", "propertyValue");
```

To remove the context once you are done with it you can call `removeObject`. 

```js
crsbinding.data.removeObject(contextId);
```

If however you have bound elements to that context it might be better to just use a brute force clean function that get's rid of all traces in the dom and data.

```js
crsbinding.utils.forceClean(contextId);
```

## Set property value

## Get property value

## Listen to changes on path

`crsbinding.events.listenOnPath(context, property, callback)`  
This function allows you to be notified if a property changes.  
The path is the object path relative to the context.  

Consider the following object structure.
```js
this.setProperty("model", {
    person: {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe"
    }
})
``` 

Let's declare a path to listen on.  
```js
crsbinding.events.listenOnPath(this, "model.person.firstName", callback);
``` 

If anything changes that affects that path, the callback function will be called.  

1. model is replaced with a different object
1. person is replaced with a different object
1. first name changes to a different value

The property parameter can also be an array of paths.

```js
crsbinding.events.listenOnPath(this, ["model.person.firstName", "model.person.lastName"], callback);
```

## Listen to changes from this point forward
