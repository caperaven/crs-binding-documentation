# Binding basics

## Introduction
This document looks a bit at the mechanics of how the HTML element and JavaScrpt is combined into a binding.

Binding creates a link between the DOM and a JavaScript object so that they can easily communicate with each other through expressions and events.

In future documentations we will look at the view model and bindable element. These are the more practical uses of creating bindings.

## Example

```html
<body>
    <script type="module" src="./node_modules/crs-binding/crs-binding.js"></script>

    <main>
        <label>
            <div>${titles.firstName}</div>
            <input value.bind="data.firstName" />
        </label>
        <label>
            <div>${titles.lastName}</div>
            <input value.bind="data.lastName" />
        </label>

        <button click.call="print">Print</button>
    </main>

    <script type="module">
        const model = crsbinding.observation.observe({
            titles: {
                firstName: "First Name",
                lastName: "Last Name"
            },
            data: {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Doe"
            },
            print() {
                console.log(`${this.data.firstName} ${this.data.lastName}`);
            }
        });

        const element = document.querySelector("main");

        crsbinding.parsers.parseElement(element, model);
    </script>
</body>
```

These are the steps used above.

1. Create a object literal and observe it using `crsbinding.observation.observe`
1. Get the element that I want to create a binding with.
1. Bind the two by parsing the selected element and sending the observed model on as the context.

Binding expressions are relative to the context you passed on.
The actual data structure you use does not really matter as long as the expression is relative to the context.

In the above example you can see that we are using the title.firstName for the label text. This is a nice way to deal with multi language. Get the right value from the language file and update the data property to the appropriate value and the binding will take care of the rest.

As you can see here we are not jumping through a lot of gymnastics to bring data from the model to the UI and visa versa. When I click the print button the print function is called. All you need to do is use the right binding expression for the right intent.

Once you are done with this and you want to release the memory it is important you decouple the items again or you will end up with a memory leak.

There are two functions you can use.

1. `crsbinding.observation.releaseBinding` 
1. `crsbinding.observation.releaseChildBinding`

`releaseBinding` you pass the element you want to unbind and it will take things from there.

`releaseChildBinding` you also pass in the element, but in this case it will not unbind the element, only the children of that element.
