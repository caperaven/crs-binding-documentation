# Processes

## Introduction
For this, you will need crs-process-api
```
npm install crs-process-api
```

crs-process-api allows you to define process schemas and execute processes or process steps.  
What we want to do is allow you to execute a process or step with out having to write javascript, instead we want to setup a binding expression in the HTML that will do this for us.

## Scenarios
There are three main scenarios.

1. Execute a custom crafted step
2. Execute a process system function
3. Execute a process in a schema

To understand these scenarios, you might want to familiarize yourself with the [process documentation](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-process-api/blob/master/readme.md).

### custom step example
```
<button click.process="{type: 'console', action: 'log', args: {messages: [$context.value, 'world']}, next_step:''}">Execute Step</button>
```

In this example we declare a object literal that will execute the log function on the console system.  
It is important to note that it looks exactly like it would have in a crs-process-api schema.  
When executing the step, the process and the item parameters will be null because they are not present.  
You should keep that in mind when defining args parameters as the only access you have is the context or hard coded values.

### calling system function directly example
```
<button click.process="console.log({ messages: ['wazaaap', 'yall'] })">Call Function</button>
```

### simple process with no parameters
```
<button click.process="process_schema[simple()]">Simple Process</button>
```

### process with parameters
```
<button click.process="process_schema[binding(bId, value: $context.value)]">Bound Process</button>
```
