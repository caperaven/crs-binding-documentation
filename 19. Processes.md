# Processes

## Introduction
For this, you will need crs-process-api
```
npm install crs-process-api
```

crs-process-api allows you to define process schemas and execute processes or process steps.  
What we want to do is allow you to execute a process or step with out having to write javascript, instead we want to setup a binding expression in the HTML that will do this for us.

## Scenarios
There are three main scenarios.

1. Execute a custom crafted step
2. Execute a process system function
3. Execute a process in a schema

To understand these scenarios, you might want to familiarize yourself with the [process documentation](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-process-api/blob/master/readme.md).

### custom step example
```
<button click.process="{type: 'console', action: 'log', args: {messages: [$context.value, 'world']}}">Execute Step</button>
```

In this example we declare a object literal that will execute the log function on the console system.  
It is important to note that it looks exactly like it would have in a crs-process-api schema.  
When executing the step, the process and the item parameters will be null because they are not present.  
You should keep that in mind when defining args parameters as the only access you have is the context or hard coded values.

### calling system function directly example
```
<button click.process="console.log({ messages: ['wazaaap', 'yall'] })">Call Function</button>
```

This syntax is a bit more like a standard function call passing a object literal as a parameter.  
crs-binding-api functions can be called programatically where you pass the step in.  
The difference here is that we don't pass on the step information but instead just the args property of the step.  

Normally if you called the system function directly you would do something like

```
crs.intent.console.log(...)
```

The syntax in the button just shortens that where you don't need to define `crs.intent`

### simple process with no parameters
```
<button click.process="process_schema[simple()]">Simple Process</button>
```
One schema can have multiple processes.  
crs-process-api allows you to call a process on a defined schema using event aggregation.  
This syntax allows you to call that event agrregation by defining the schema and then the process on that schema with what ever parameters you may need.

```
schema[process(args)]
```

The schema part of this command refers to the id property in the schema that resides on the schema registry.  
The process refers to the process property in the schema.


### process with parameters
```
<button click.process="process_schema[binding(bId, value: $context.value)]">Bound Process</button>
```

This example is the same as the above, but some processes require parameters to run as defined in the parameters_def property of the process.

```
parameters_def: {
    bId: { type: "number", required: true },
    value: { type: "number", required: true }
},
```

bId is a reserved word that refers to passing the binding context to the process so that it can access the binding context.  
Instead of forcing you to write the property, value pairing you can just use the work "bId" in the args as seen above.  
The system will take care of populating the right binding context. To be clear it will be the same context the button is on, be it a view model or bindable element.  
In the above example we are also passing a parameter that will contain the value property of the context.
The context for these calls is always the context the button is on, so you can access property getters and bound values.
