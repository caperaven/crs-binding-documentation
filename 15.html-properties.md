# HTML Properties

## Introduction
The binding engine deals with binding as text content or inner text but there are times when the text content you use is HTML.  
In those cases you want the binding engine to use innerHTML.  

Consider the following binding expression.

```html
<div>${$html.model.value}</div>
```

You will notice that the property path has a prefix `$html.`.  
This prefix indicates that the value from "model.value" must be treated as HTML.  

If the model.value equals "<h2>Hello World</h2>", it will be added as innerHTML.  
The result will thus be.

```html
<div>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
</div>
```

## Use case
This is a easy way to have different menu items where you can inject custom elements in an existing for expression.
