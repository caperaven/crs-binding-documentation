# Arrays

## Introduction
This section takes a quick look at working with arrays.    
When working with the repeat ui you bind to an array of values.  
There are times though that you want to manipulate the data by adding or removing items.

As a rule the crs-binding does not use proxies and is reliant on setProperty to notify changes.  
When working with arrays that is not possible as arrays have internal functions for making changes.  
When these functions are used you want to get some idea of what is being done to the array so that items can be updated.

When performing manipulation actions such as `push` or `pop` you should request an proxy version of the array.  
When making changes to the proxy version the binding engine will update the UI as required by adding or removing items.

You can request the proxy version of the array using `crs-binding.data.array()`;

```js
const proxy = crsbinding.data.array(this, "items");
proxy.push(newItem);
```

If you want to get the array without it being made a proxy you can use the normal "getValue" function.

```js
const items = crsbinding.data.getValue(this, "items");
```

## Updating array values
Lets say we want to set the "selectedId" property on the first item in the array to true.  
You would do that by using setProperty as you would on any other object. 

```js
crsbinding.data.setProperty(items[0], "isSelected", true);
```

In this case the array does not have to be a proxy.
