# Arrays

## Introduction
This section takes a quick look at working with arrays.    
When working with the repeat ui you bind to an array of values.  
There are times though that you want to manipulate the data by adding or removing items.

As a rule the crs-binding does not use proxies and is reliant on setProperty to notify changes.  
When working with arrays that is not possible as arrays have internal functions for making changes.  
When these functions are used you want to get some idea of what is being done to the array so that items can be updated.

When performing manipulation actions such as `push` or `pop` you should request an proxy version of the array.  
When making changes to the proxy version the binding engine will update the UI as required by adding or removing items.

You can request the proxy version of the array using `crs-binding.data.array()`;

```js
const proxy = crsbinding.data.array(this, "items");
proxy.push(newItem);
```

If you want to get the array without it being made a proxy you can use the normal "getProperty" function.

```js
const items = this.getProperty("items");
```

## Updating array values
Lets say we want to set the "selectedId" property on the first item in the array to true.  
You would do that by using setProperty as you would on any other object. 

```js
crsbinding.data.setProperty(items[0], "isSelected", true);
```

In this case the array does not have to be a proxy.

## Array per for
Currently we only support one for statement per array.

```html
<template for="item of items"></template>
```

If you do try and declare more than one for statement on the same array, the last will work, the first will be ignored during updates.

## Sync arrays
Consider the following example

I have array of objects with the following structure

```js
{
    id: 1,
    title: "item 1",
    isSelected: true
}
```

I want to show these items in a list so that I can select some of them.

```html
<template for="item of available">
    <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked.bind="item.isSelected" />
        <input value.bind="item.title"></input>
    </li>
</template>
```

Clicking on a button you want to take the selected items and map them to a new array but with a slightly different structure.

```js
const selected = this.getProperty("available").filter(item => item.isSelected == true).map(item => {
    return {
        id: item.id,
        title: item.title,
        width: "200px"
    }
})

this.setProperty("selected", selected);
```

This new list you render much the same way as the available example above.  
There is one problem though.  
When you change the title in the available array you also want it to be updated in the selected array.

This is where sync comes in.

First start off by creating a sync object on the binding engine.

```js
crsbinding.data.createArraySync(this, "available", "id", ["title"]).then(syncId => this.syncId = syncId);
```

The parameters here are as following:

1. context of the first array to use
1. the path on that context of that array
1. what property on the object in the array must be used as a primary key to find the same object in the other array.
1. what are the fields you want to keep in sync.

We get back a sync id that we use to register other arrays with.

```js
crsbinding.data.addArraySync(this.syncId, this, "selected");
```

Now when you change the title of the object in the available objects array using the binding engine, it will also update the object with the same id in the selected array.
