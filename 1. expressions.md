# Expressions

## Introduction
Expressions is the most basic part of crs-binding.  
An expression defines what text result you require from a given model.  
This could be either a single field's value or a string that comprises out of text and values.

## Example
```js
const exp = `${firstName} ${lastName} is ${age} old and lives at "${address.street}"`;
```

This expression constant returns a sentence build up from text and values.  
To make use of the expression you need to first compile it.

```js
crsbinding.expression.compile(exp)
```
