# Expressions

## Introduction
Expressions is the most basic part of crs-binding.  
An expression defines what text result you require from a given model.  
This could be either a single field's value or a string that comprises out of text and values.

## Example
```js
const exp = `${firstName} ${lastName} is ${age} old and lives at "${address.street}"`;
```

This expression constant returns a sentence build up from text and values.  
To make use of the expression you need to first compile it.

```js
const exp = crsbinding.expression.compile(exp);
```

The result of this compilation returns a object containing:

1. execution function
1. a parameters object containing details about the expression like what property paths exist in the expression.

crs-binding uses this information internally but it is also useful when debugging expressions.  
From a use case scenario the property you are most interested in is the function because this is what you will use.

Lets say that we have the following object.

```js
const model = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 20,
    address: {
        street: "No Where"
    }
}
```

What we want to get back is the populated expression, in other words:

```js
'John Doe is 20 old and lives at "No Where"'
```

To do that call the function provided on the compiled expression.

```js
const result = exp.function(model);
```

If the original expression string changes you will need to dispose of the expression and recompile it.

Using ```crsbinding.expression.release(exp);``` will clean up the memory used by the compiled expression.
It is important that you call this once you are done with the compiled expression.

The compiled expression function can be called as many times you need too with out having to recompile it.

When you define binding expressions, it uses this under the hood to resolve those expressions and populate the DOM with the processed value.
