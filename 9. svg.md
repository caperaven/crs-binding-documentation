#SVG support

## Introduction
This document will provide some examples of how to interact with svg using crs-binding.
This includes things like

1. setting text
1. changing the fill or stroke values based on conditions

## Text
```html
<text x="10" y="20">${title}</text>
```

In this example you can see how the title text binding works.  
Simply, it is the same way as you would update text on any other text DOM Element using the inner expression using the string template syntax.

## Fill and Stroke
Lets say that you want to change the fill and stroke colors depending on a condition.

```html
<text x="10" y="20" fill.if="isActive == true ? 'green' : 'red'">${title}</text>
```

The attribute here needs to be `fill="green"` but if you remove the string quotes from the color names the binding engine thinks you are trying to bind it to a property on the context. In this case you define the color between string quotes and the binding engine will remove them for you when setting the attribute.

The end result being

```html
<text x="10" y="20" fill="green">SVG Test</text>
```
