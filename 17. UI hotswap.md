# UI Hotswapping

## Introduction
This is the ability to swap UI parts in and out based on requirement.  
This goes beyond just showing and hiding UI it adds and removes elements in the DOM.  
This should be used mindfully because any time you add or remove items from the DOM can be expensive.

In scenarios when you do this on a user action it is acceptable.  
Trying to perform this kind of operation on a frequent loop N amount of times per second is not.  

## Scenarios
There are three main scenarios we will cover here.

1. As part of a self contained component.  
2. Using perspective-element as part of a parent context.
3. Using perspective-element to load HTML fragments.

## Basics
Either way the content is defined as templates.  
Each template must have a data-id attribute that defines the view id.
